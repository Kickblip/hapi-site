## Maintaining

Almost all the editable content is under the `/content/` directory in JSONs

### How can I run this locally?

Clone the repo and install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/Kickblip/hapi-site.git
cd hapi-site
npm install
```

_If you don't have npm, [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)_

Create a `.env.local` file at the root of the project and paste the following into it

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMSUBMIT_CONTACT=example@example.com # Not important
```

Run the dev server

```
npm run dev
```

Finally, navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser of choice
